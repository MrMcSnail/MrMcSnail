I’m currently undertaking Northcoders’ Software Development bootcamp to become a Full-Stack Developer.

Previous to this I have been a Primary Teacher (6yrs) and an Actor (10 yrs).


I think software has a real power to drive change in people’s lives, in organisations and in society. I’m passionate about finding solutions for people that truly work. I believe that people-centred solutions don’t just solve problems, but provide new paradigms for living, working and thriving.
