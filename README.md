I think software has a real power to drive change in people’s lives, in organisations and in society. I’m passionate about finding solutions for people that truly work. I believe that people-centred solutions don’t just solve problems, but provide new paradigms for living, working and thriving.

I’m currently a Junior Software Engineer and Mentor at Northcoders

Previous to this I was a Primary Teacher (6yrs) and an Actor (10 yrs).
